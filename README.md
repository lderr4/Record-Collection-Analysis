# Record-Collection-Analysis

For this project I will be analyzing my Dad's large record collection and extracting insights from it. My dad has documented his entire collection on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com), an online record collection marketplace/hub. [Here](https://www.discogs.com/user/hackerofslop) is a link to his account. I will use the Discogs API to load his collection into memory and try to extract insights from it.
