# Record-Collection-Analysis

In this project I analyzed my Dad's large record collection and extracted insights from it. My dad has documented his entire collection on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com), an online record collection marketplace/hub. [Here](https://www.discogs.com/user/hackerofslop) is a link to his account. I will use the Discogs API to load his collection into memory and try to extract insights from it.

[Here](record_collection_analysis/record_collection_analysis.md) is the code!
